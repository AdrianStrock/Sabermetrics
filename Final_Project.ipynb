    "BUP/PUP are stats that attempt to capture a player's performance in clutch situations. For our purposes, a clutch situation is defined as any play in the 7th inning or later in which the winning/tied team can fall behind. A non-clutch situation will be any play which is not in this subset. A hitter's BUP(BA) will thus be calculated by subtracting his BA in non-clutch situations from his BA in clutch situations. "
